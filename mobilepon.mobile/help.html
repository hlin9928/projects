        <p><b>How Can I Save a Coupon</b>
        Add the business to your favorites. Then go to Favorites section, you can always view your favorite business or coupon from there.

        <p><b>How Can I Share a Coupon with Friends</b>
        On the business page, you can share the business or coupon by clicking on Facebook, Twitter or Email button.

        <p><b>How do I redeem a coupon or a reward?</b>
        Each store will have their own redemption process, but in general you'll just need to show the coupon or your reward points on your phone to the cashier and have the cashier redeem the coupon or rewards. While most businesses listed in the app will alow you to redeem from your phone, we recommend that you call ahead to confirm.
        <p><b>How often are new coupons added?</b>

        New coupons are added approximately every 2 to 4 weeks, depending on your location.

        <p><b>Why am I seeing coupons from my old location?</b>
        To conserve battery life, many mobile devices do not maintain a constant GPS connection. This can sometimes lead to an old location being presented until the device can re-establish a conneciton and refresh the location. This normally takes 10-30 seconds to resolve.

        <p><b>Why aren't there coupons for businesses in my area?</b>
        We are constantly adding new businesses, so be sure to check back soon. If there's a local business you'd like to see in Mobilepon, let the owner know! 

        <p><b>How to Turn on GPS on My Cell Phone</b>
        If your device is equipped with GPS, be sure that it is turned on. On the iPhone, go to Settings/General/Location Services to turn on your GPS. On Android devices, go to Settings/Location.
