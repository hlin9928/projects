         <p>Mobilepon is an online service that provides coupons, deals, rewards of local business and lots more. Our website, mobile properties, and related applications (collectively, our "Website") are part of the Mobilepon, which is owned and operated by Red Star Internet, Inc..
<p>
We understand that providing information online involves a great deal of trust on your part. We take this trust very seriously, and make it a high priority to ensure the security and confidentiality of the personal information you provide to us when you visit our Website or use our services. Before submitting your personal information to us, please read this Policy carefully to learn about our privacy practices. By visiting Mobilepon’s website, www.Mobilepon.com, or using a Mobilepon application (an "Application" or "App") on a mobile phone, tablet, or similar device (a "Device") or in connection with other sites or services, you are accepting the practices described herein.


<p><b>What information we collect from you</b>
<p><b>In General.</b>
<p>
We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or give us in any other way. This includes information that can identify you ("personal information"), including your first and last name, and email addresses, user name and password, and billing information (such as your credit card number, cardholder name, and card expiration date). You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to receive relevant offerings from Mobilepon and its partners and enjoy other benefits of being a registered member. For example, only registered members are able to view some offerings from some businesses. In addition, some information is also required in order for you to ask us a question or initiate other transactions on our site.
<p><b>Information About Others.</b>

<p>
You will have the opportunity to provide contact and travel-related information for other people through our Website. If you make a reservation for someone else through Mobilepon, you will need to submit that individual’s personal information. You must obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing us with their personal information, as any access to view or modify their information will be available only through your account.

<p><b>Information from Other Sources.</b>
<p>
We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to other information about you. For example, if you visit Mobilepon by "clicking through" from a site operated by one of our business partners, and you have registered with that partner, then information about you that you have provided to that partner may be shared with us, such as contact information and demographic information. As another example, if you access third party services, such as social media services, through our Website or before coming to our Website, we may collect information such as your user name, password, and other information made available to us through those services. We will work with our existing partners and potential future partners to improve and personalize your use of our Website in accordance with the practices outlined in this section and Policy.
<p>
We have partnered with Facebook to provide personalized content on Mobilepon for members of Facebook. If you are logged into Facebook and Mobilepon, Mobilepon will be personalized for you when you visit the Website, even if you are a first-time user of Mobilepon’s Website.

<p><b>Automatic Information.</b>

We automatically collect some information from your computer or Device when you visit Mobilepon. For example, we will collect session data, including your IP address, Web browser software, and referring website. We also may collect information about your online activity, such as content viewed, pages visited, and searches and/or reservations facilitated or made. One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to help us understand the interests and preferences of our users and customize your user experience.
<p><b>Payment Information.</b>
<P>
If you make travel reservations with third-party suppliers facilitated by Mobilepon, we will collect payment information from you, including your credit card number, cardholder name, expiration date, authentication code, and billing address. We will securely transmit this information to the supplier of the travel reservation to complete the transaction. Please note that the supplier processes your payment, not Mobilepon, unless otherwise specified. You agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s policies and procedures before making a reservation through Mobilepon.
<P>
We may offer members the option to save information related to method and choice of payment on our Website. If you save such payment details on Mobilepon, you will be able to add, delete, or modify that information at any time in Account Settings.
<p><b>Location Information and Other Information from Devices.</b>

<P>
When you use an Application on a Device, we will collect and use information about you in generally similar ways and for similar purposes as when you use the Mobilepon website. In addition, we may collect information about your location if you have instructed your Device to send such information to the Application via the privacy settings on that Device, or if you have uploaded photos tagged with location information. We may use the location information collected from your Device or photos to enhance your use of the Application by providing you with relevant content and contextual advertising. For example, we may use your location to show you reviews of hotels or restaurants near you when you are traveling. You can change the privacy settings of your Device at any time, in order to turn off the functionality to share location information with the Application and/or the functionality to tag your photos with location information. Please note that turning off location sharing may affect certain features of our App. If you have any queries about the privacy settings of your Device, we suggest you contact the manufacturer of your Device or your mobile service provider for help.

<p><b>Cookies and Other Web Technologies.</b>
Cookies are small data text files and can be stored on your computer’s hard drive or your Device (if your Web browser permits). Mobilepon, its affiliated websites, and Apps use cookies for the following general purposes:
<p>
    To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting our site. For example, if you register on our site, we may use cookies to remember your registration information, so you do not need to log into our site each time you visit. We also may record your password in a cookie, if you checked the box entitled "Save this password for automatic sign-in." Please note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes.
    To help us customize the content, experience, and advertisements provided to you on our websites and Apps and on other websites across the Internet. For example, when you access a web page, a cookie is automatically set by us, our service providers, or our partners to recognize your browser as you navigate on the Internet and to present you with information and advertising based on your apparent interests. See Display of Advertising/Your Choices for more information about our online advertising practices and your choices.<br>
    To help measure and research the effectiveness of features and offerings, advertisements, and email communications (by determining which emails you open and act upon).
<P>
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers should tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable most types of cookies. Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to access many of the travel tools offered on our sites.
<P>
Our sites also may use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a Web page. We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, and to improve site performance. We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and actions on our site. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings.

<p><b>How we use your information</b>
Mobilepon uses the information we collect about you for the following general purposes: for registration and to manage your account, including to allow your access to and use of our site; to communicate with you in general, including to provide information about Mobilepon and invitations from the Mobilepon community; to respond to your questions and comments; to measure interest in and improve our products, services, and Website; to notify you about special offers and products or services available from us or our partners that may be of interest to you; to otherwise customize your experience with Mobilepon, including customizing the ads shown to you; to solicit information from you, including through surveys; to resolve disputes or troubleshoot problems; to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; to enforce our Terms of Use; and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection.
<P>

We may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors our Website receives or the most popular hotels and vacation destinations. This information does not contain any personal information and is used to develop content and services we hope you will find of interest.
How you can access your information
<P>
We take reasonable steps to ensure that your information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, and complete. You can access and update your contact information by visiting the Member Profile page on the Mobilepon Website. You can close your Mobilepon account by contacting us using this form. We will send you an email to confirm your request. Please note that after you close an account, you will not be able to sign in or access any of your personal information. However, you can open a new account at any time. Please also note that we may retain certain information associated with your account in our archives, including for analytical purposes as well as for recordkeeping integrity.
Your choices with respect to the collection and use of your information
<P>
    As discussed above, you can choose not to provide us with any information, although it may be needed to take advantage of certain features offered on Mobilepon.
    You also can add or update information and close your account as described above. If you decide to close your Mobilepon account, we will deactivate your account and remove your profile information from active view. Please note, however, that we may retain in our files some information associated with your account and past transactions for purposes including backups, fraud prevention, dispute resolution, investigations, and compliance with legal requirements.
    As a registered Mobilepon member, you can modify your email subscription choices at any time on the Member Profile page. Whether registered as a Mobilepon member or not, you also will be given the opportunity to unsubscribe from promotional messages in any such email we send. Please note that we reserve the right to send you other communications, including service announcements, administrative messages, and surveys relating either to your Mobilepon account, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.
    Email Communications. Mobilepon wants to make it easy for you to take advantage of travel-related opportunities on our Website. One way we do this is by sending you email messages that contain information about your apparent travel-related interests. For example, if you search for a flight to New York, or New York hotels or reviews on Mobilepon, we may send you an email message reminding you about special airfare or hotel offers in New York. Similarly, if you receive an email about New York travel and demonstrate an interest in New York hotels, flights, or local travel reviews by affirmatively clicking on a link about New York hotels in the email, you may receive an email about New York hotel or flight offers. We believe these email messages will provide you with useful information about travel-related special offers available through our sites. Please note that you will have the opportunity to choose not to receive these email messages in any such email we send.
    The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies from Mobilepon, you will not be able to access portions of our site.
<p><b>Children's privacy</b>
Mobilepon is a general audience site and does not offer services directed to children. Should an individual whom we know to be a child under age 13 send personal information to us, we will delete or destroy such information as soon as reasonably possible.
<P>
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us at the address provided below in the "How you can contact us" section.

Mobilepon may change or modify this Privacy Policy in the future. We will note the date that revisions were last made to this Privacy Policy at the bottom of this page, and any revisions will take effect upon posting.
